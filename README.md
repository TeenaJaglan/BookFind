# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh 

this project has the following functionalities-
- user can search for the books :
    - via title, author name,publish year,publisher,category,number of pages etc .
    - the book  data containes all the book related data with the functionality of buy now or add to the cart.
    - after login or signup , the profile photo gets created via dicebar .
    - user can logout successfully with double confirmtion .'
    - this website contains responsive design both for mobile and pc versions.
    - optimize code is used with redux toolkit, react-router,axios , localStorage etc .

******:
- user can signup/login on to the website but since database is not connected  therefore can't do the backend part for login ,but website is ready completely from the frontend part.
- due to some app issues , i could not  join the backend part and tailwind css .
- . the server load was increasing,due to some technical issues can't connect to mongodb ,not supporting some modules and then in the end had to move to only frontend part ,  as an alternatives .
